# 5. Objects

From [Manage large CSS projects with ITCSS](https://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/manage-large-css-projects-itcss-101517528#layers), Harry Roberts:

> Users of OOCSS will be familiar with the concept of objects. This is the first layer in which we find class-based selectors. These are concerned with styling non-cosmetic design patterns, or 'objects'. Objects can range from something as simple as a .wrapper element, to layout systems, through to things like the OOCSS poster child – the Media Object. This layer affects less of the DOM than the last layer, has a higher specificity, and is slightly more explicit in that we are now targeting sections of the DOM with classes.
