# 3. Generic

From [Manage large CSS projects with ITCSS](https://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/manage-large-css-projects-itcss-101517528#layers), Harry Roberts:

> The Generic layer is the first one that actually produces any CSS. It houses very high-level, far reaching styles. This layer is seldom modified, and is usually the same across any projects you work on. It contains things like Normalize.css, global box-sizing rules, CSS resets and so on. The Generic layer affects a lot of the DOM, hence it being nice and wide in the Triangle model, and occurring very early on.

## In this layer

### Reset

Reset styles using declarations copied from [HTML 5 Reset](http://html5reset.org/).

### HTML

Set up some basic styles for html and body.
